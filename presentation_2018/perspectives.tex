{Continue to build a community}
\begin{itemize}
\item In each activity:
\begin{itemize}
\item Emerging projects
\item Idex chairs
\item Bottom-up Working Groups\\
  are the driving force of collaborative work
\end{itemize}

\item 
Connect researchers beyond their specific domain

\begin{itemize}
\item Foster cross-domain inspiration and reuse of methods
\item Beyond tasks
\item Beyond action lines
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{DataSense Perspectives}

Co-organized Seminars,
expressed as problems which require two types of expertise, e.g.:

\begin{itemize}
% \item I have collected 72 million forum messages with various metadata and links: how do I best store and query these data?
% \item I was given a heap of unstructured Web pages from which I must collect person names: how do I do?
\item Machine Learning+Heterogeneous data and knowledge:
  What kind of neural network should I train to merge word and concept spaces?
  % to index texts with ontological concepts?
% \item I want to record user interactions with my system: what are the best practices?
\item Knowledge+Visualization: What kinds of visualizations can help me explore an ontology with six million concepts?
% \item Which graph algorithms best find similar nodes in graphs of words?
\item Security+Text: How can I assess the risk of re-identification of a de-identified text corpus?

\item  Towards co-construction of joint projects
\end{itemize}

Shared Tasks

\begin{itemize}
\item In collaboration with the Center for Data Science, DataIA.
\item Objective: Define together cross-domain datasets and shared tasks
\end{itemize}
